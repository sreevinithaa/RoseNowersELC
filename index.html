                <h3>Rose Nowers History</h3>
                <p>Rose Nowers (nee-Clark) was the daughter of Laurie and Catherine Clark and grew up within the Port
                    Headland Region.Rose was a trained nurse and during the war years travelled to Perth wanting to join
                    the armed Services.However, she was an Aboriginal womanRose was always involved in human right
                    issues for people in general.In the early forties a large community meeting was arranged for
                    Aboriginal people in the hall in Port Hedland.Son Mcleod addressed this meeting and Rose was so
                    exited that she forgot to take the minutes of the meeting.
                <p>Rose later married Tom Nowers and had a large family.Rose's community involvement was widespread and
                    did not just involve Aboriginal people.She was involved with many community areas and organisations
                    such as the aged people's home and helping start the Aboriginal progress association.Rose was a
                    member of the Pundulmurra Advisory Committee during the '70's and she was the only Aboriginal women
                    on the Hedland College Streering Committee when the groundwork was being done.
                    Rosse Nowers was a hard worker for the benefit of all people in the community - her one regret in
                    life was that the Clark family was never given the recognition it deserved in Port Hedland as she
                    followed in the footsteps of a great man...her father.
